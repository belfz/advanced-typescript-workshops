# the Advanced TypeScript workshops

All source code files can be run with:
- node.js v20.18.0 (LTS):
    - using ts-node: `npm run exec <path_to_file.ts>`
    - or building first with `npm run build` and then `node dist/<path_to_file.js>`
- bun (1.1.27): `bun run <path_to_file.ts>`

Remember to install the dependencies first (either with `npm i` or `bun install`).
